# Brownian Motion

Brownian Motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collision with other atoms or molecules. Certain robot applications like exploration, coverage and swarm dynamics require the use of Brownian Motion. This challenge requires you to implement and simulate Brownian Motion type behavior on a robot.
